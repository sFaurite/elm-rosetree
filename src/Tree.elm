{-| A multiway tree or rosetree is a labeled tree where each node can have zero,
one or more children, each of which represents a tree in its own right.

The root of the tree is always labeled, so a tree always has at least one label.

As an example, such a structure could represent a directory structure:

    tree "root"
        [ tree "home"
            [ tree "user1" []
            , tree "user2" []
            ]
        , tree "etc" []
        , tree "var"
            [ tree "log" []
            ]
        ]

In a sense, `Html msg` is pretty similar to how such trees look, but they can be
used to represent other things. A nested menu structure, or a sitemap, or any
other structure where a single root is connected to children which can each have
children of their own, and so on.

Running the function on the seed should return a label and a list of seeds to
use for the children.

that int as the label, with its children representing the integers from 0 up to
but not including the value. The expected result is a tree in which each label
has the number of children mentioned in the label, recursively.

Or perhaps you have your own tree datastructure and you want to convert to it:

    type MyTree a = MyTree a (List (MyTree a))


    tree "root"
        [ tree "folder"
            [ singleton "foo"
            , singleton "bar"
            ]
        , singleton "yeah"
        ]
        |> restructure identity MyTree
    --> MyTree "root"
    -->     [ MyTree "folder"
    -->         [ MyTree "foo" []
    -->         , MyTree "bar" []
    -->         ]
    -->     , MyTree "yeah" []
    -->     ]
